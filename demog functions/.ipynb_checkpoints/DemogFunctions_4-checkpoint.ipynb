    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the fourth part of our demographic functions series! Thus far, we've looked at measures of fertility and childbearing. But... the issue with the TFR is that it does not account for mortality and hence doesn't actually give a good idea of measures of reproduction and replacement. Today, we'll be looking at the **Gross Reproduction Rate** and **Net Reproduction Rate**, which will allow us to do **Population Projection**\n",

    "## Key Measure 6 - Gross and Net Reproduction Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Since females are the only ones that can reproduce naturally, we usually take the Reproduction Rate as benchmarked agains the number of females. Hence, the Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) is defined as the size of the cohort of daughters relative to the cohort of mums. To get this, we essentially multiply the TFR against the ratio of female births over total births. This is usually assumed to be *0.49*, 105 male births for every 100 female births. Another way to calculate GRR is as the sum of age-specific fertility rates, only considering daughters -  we will use this method later for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Gross Reproduction Rate does not take into account mortality and mortality would affect the reproduction potential of the next generation. We hence have to use the Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) which takes into account mortality levels. The NRR, hence, quantifies how a population will growth (NRR > 1 will lead to population growth and NRR < 1 will lead to a decline in population). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculations aren't that difficult. We essentially have to transform age-specific fertility rates to *female-only* and then sum it up to get GRR. We can then multiply this by mortality to get NRR. Let's get to it!"

    "Using the NRR, we can also calulcate the intrinsic rate of natural increase (r) or the population growth rate. This is easily approximated by taking the ln of NRR and dividing it by the mean age of childbearing. The mean age of childbearing can also be thought of as the mean length of a generation because it represents the length of time that the next generation will begin childbearing. Hence, we divide it by the length of the generation to find out the intrinsic rate of natural increase. \n",

We first calculate the total number of births and then divide it by the daughter ASFRs (accounted for mortality) to get the average age of birth."
